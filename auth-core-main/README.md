The `AuthService.cs` and `Program.cs` files are key components of the AuthCore application. Here's a brief explanation of each:

## AuthService.cs

This file contains the `AuthService` class, which is responsible for generating JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. The `GenerateToken` method is the core of this service. It creates a JWT with claims based on the user's details and signs it with a private key. The token is then returned as a string.

The `GenerateClaims` method is a helper function that creates a `ClaimsIdentity` object from the user's details. These claims are then included in the JWT.

The `ValidatePassword` method is a placeholder for password validation logic. In a real-world application, this would involve hashing the provided password and comparing it with the stored hashed password.

### Program.cs Explained

This file contains the main entry point for the application. It sets up the application's services and middleware, configures authentication and authorization, and defines the application's endpoints.

The `AddAuthentication` and `AddJwtBearer` methods configure JWT-based authentication for the application. The `AddAuthorization` method sets up an authorization policy that requires the user to have the "admin" role.

The `AddTransient<AuthService>` line registers the `AuthService` with the dependency injection container, so it can be injected into other parts of the application as needed.

The `AddEndpointsApiExplorer` and `AddSwaggerGen` methods enable and configure the Swagger UI, which provides a visual interface for testing the API.

The `app.MapPost("/authenticate", ...)` line defines a route for authenticating users. When a POST request is made to this endpoint with user credentials, a JWT is generated for the user.

The `app.MapGet("/signin", ...)` line defines a route that requires authorization. Only users with a valid JWT that includes the "admin" role can access this endpoint.



### Main Components

The main components of the AuthCore application are:

1. `AuthService.cs`: This is a service class responsible for generating JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. It includes methods for generating tokens, creating claims based on user details, and validating passwords.

2. `Program.cs`: This is the main entry point for the application. It sets up the application's services and middleware, configures authentication and authorization, and defines the application's endpoints.

3. `AuthCore.csproj`: This is the project file, which specifies the target framework, nullable reference types, implicit usings, and package references.

4. `appsettings.json`: This file contains application-wide settings, such as logging levels and allowed hosts.

5. `Properties/launchSettings.json`: This file contains settings for launching the application, including the URLs for the application when running in different environments (http, https, IIS Express).

These components work together to create a secure authentication solution using JWT and .NET 8 minimal API.
