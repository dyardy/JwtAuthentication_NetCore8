**AuthCore** is an ASP.NET Core authentication application that leverages .NET 8 minimal API and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This application is designed to provide a secure and efficient way to manage user authentication in your ASP.NET Core applications.

Securing user authentication is a critical aspect of any application. Here are some best practices:

1. **Password Hashing and Salting**: Never store passwords in plain text. Always hash and salt passwords before storing them. This makes it difficult for an attacker to retrieve the original password even if they gain access to your database.

2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for communication, especially when transmitting sensitive data like usernames and passwords. This prevents attackers from eavesdropping on the data being transmitted.

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

4. **Use JWTs Wisely**: If you're using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), ensure they are stored securely on the client side. Avoid storing them in local storage as they can be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

5. **Token Expiration**: Implement token expiration. This means that even if an attacker gets hold of a token, they can only use it for a limited time.

6. **Validate User Input**: Always validate user input on the server side to prevent SQL injection and other similar attacks.

7. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity using a second method, in addition to username and password.

8. **Regularly Update and Patch Your Systems**: Ensure that all your systems, including servers and software, are regularly updated and patched with the latest security updates.

9. **Use Secure Password Policies**: Enforce secure password policies, such as minimum length, requiring a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, and regular password changes.

10. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: If you need to store sensitive data, make sure it's encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm.

Remember, security is a continuous process and requires regular review and updates to keep up with new threats and vulnerabilities.



## AuthService.cs

This file contains the `AuthService` class, which is responsible for generating JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. The `GenerateToken` method is the core of this service. It creates a JWT with claims based on the user's details and signs it with a private key. The token is then returned as a string.

The `GenerateClaims` method is a helper function that creates a `ClaimsIdentity` object from the user's details. These claims are then included in the JWT.

The `ValidatePassword` method is a placeholder for password validation logic. In a real-world application, this would involve hashing the provided password and comparing it with the stored hashed password.

### Program.cs Explained

This file contains the main entry point for the application. It sets up the application's services and middleware, configures authentication and authorization, and defines the application's endpoints.

The `AddAuthentication` and `AddJwtBearer` methods configure JWT-based authentication for the application. The `AddAuthorization` method sets up an authorization policy that requires the user to have the "admin" role.

The `AddTransient<AuthService>` line registers the `AuthService` with the dependency injection container, so it can be injected into other parts of the application as needed.

The `AddEndpointsApiExplorer` and `AddSwaggerGen` methods enable and configure the Swagger UI, which provides a visual interface for testing the API.

The `app.MapPost("/authenticate", ...)` line defines a route for authenticating users. When a POST request is made to this endpoint with user credentials, a JWT is generated for the user.

The `app.MapGet("/signin", ...)` line defines a route that requires authorization. Only users with a valid JWT that includes the "admin" role can access this endpoint.



### Main Components

The main components of the AuthCore application are:

1. `AuthService.cs`: This is a service class responsible for generating JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. It includes methods for generating tokens, creating claims based on user details, and validating passwords.

2. `Program.cs`: This is the main entry point for the application. It sets up the application's services and middleware, configures authentication and authorization, and defines the application's endpoints.

3. `AuthCore.csproj`: This is the project file, which specifies the target framework, nullable reference types, implicit usings, and package references.

4. `appsettings.json`: This file contains application-wide settings, such as logging levels and allowed hosts.

5. `Properties/launchSettings.json`: This file contains settings for launching the application, including the URLs for the application when running in different environments (http, https, IIS Express).

These components work together to create a secure authentication solution using JWT and .NET 8 minimal API.
